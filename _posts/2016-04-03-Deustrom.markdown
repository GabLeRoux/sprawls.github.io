Project made for Ubisoft Gamelab 2016 with a team of four programmers from UQAC and four artists from Centre NAD. 

In Deustrom, two gods battle in the middle of a maelstrom with the goal of being immortalized by their followers. Islands are getting progressively attracted by the maelstrom and each player must protect their own while destroying the opponent's islands.
